    "# SQL Query Optimization Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll explore different ways to optimize SQL database queries using indexes, views, temporary tables, and subqueries. We will be using the [sqlite3 library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) to perform queries on our database and a [function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_sql_query.html) from pandas library to see the output from our queries. We'll be connecting directly to the chinook.db database file provided by [SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/). This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of SQL."

    "In practice, database queries are finetuned to run efficiently based on each query's unique inefficiency. These vary widely based on how often the database is updated, how often the query is performed, and whether the user prefers faster read operations or faster write operations, amongst other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be working on a relatively small dataset so the time differences between efficient and less efficient queries will be small, if at all evident. The goal is to become familiar with the common tools that can be used to speed up most queries on large datasets. As tables in the database grow large, smallest adjustments to queries can make significant execution time differences."

Instead of having to iterate through every row in a table, the program quckly determines the position of the needed row based on a given indexed column value. Primary keys in a table are indexed by default, but additional indexes based on one or more columns and column expressions can be created manually. In the chinkook database that we'll be using all primary keys and foreign keys are indexed."

    "## Part 2: Views\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of our tutorial we'll explore a way to write an efficient a query that's based on combining data from multiple tables. Views are table-like structures that can be created from a query, stored in a database and queried. Views are often used for de-normalizing data and cutomizing outputs for specific users. De-normalizing data essentially means combining multiple entities into a single table. In a proper database design, each table should store data about a single entity to avoid data redundancy which leads to [anomalies](https://databasemanagement.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Data_Anomalies). However, queries on de-normalized data are often much more time efficient. Once a view is created, it is visible to multiple clients using the database, unlike temporary tables (that we'll cover in part 3), which are session-specific."
